# Dog Activity Tracker Project

This Dog Activity Tracker project is a collaborative effort by members Dhruval Bhuva, Bushra Najeeb, and Aniket Kulkarni. The project aims to track and predict dog activities using sensor data from a Wit Motion sensor. The trained CNN model processes the sensor data to make predictions without relying on visual input.
